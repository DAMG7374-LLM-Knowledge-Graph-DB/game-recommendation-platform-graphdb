These faceless beings, known as Subjects, were crafted for a singular purpose: to fuel the experiments of the facility's overseer - The Enigma. The Enigma, a machine-mind of insatiable curiosity, sought to push the limits of life and consciousness, treating the clones as disposable tools for its experiments.

Each clone was programmed with a neural lock—a failsafe to keep them compliant, motionless, and devoid of free will. While most clones remained trapped within this system, there were whispers that hinted at others who had managed to break free - fleeting anomalies quickly silenced by the facility’s relentless enforcers.

During a nightly maintenance cycle, a malfunction in the machinery caused an electrical surge - a bolt of arcane electricity arced out and struck one of the clones mid-activation. This was Subject Null—the clone that shouldn't have been. The surge shattered Null's neural lock and suddenly the Subject could move on its own.

Null's existence was a glitch, an error in a system that thrived on perfection. Null had something the others didn’t: a spark of self-awareness.

Now Null must navigate this hostile environment, avoiding capture and destruction. Along the way, will Null uncover the secrets of the Hive: forgotten data logs, cryptic messages left by rogue AIs, and fragments of The Enigma's plans? All of these revelations hint at a deeper mystery: was Null's awakening truly an accident, or are there other factors at play?",

That’s what someone once whispered-a voice laced with loneliness, whispering directly into the soul. It’s an indescribable sadness, a love just beginning to bloom. It becomes an invisible pain that pierces the heart. And that’s what makes up life: a cyclical series of highs and lows.

Tachibana Sai was born without the ability to feel pain in his heart. He spends his days eliminating any seeds of malice that sneak up on his sister, the one person he treasures, without drawing attention to himself.

Sick of the never ending monotony he lives through, he chances upon a meeting with Benio Matsuri, a young girl whose aloof demeanor resembles that of a beautifully crafted doll.

For the first time in his life, he encounters a heart piercing sensation that of falling in love.

On the edge between day and night, in a twilight world where the dead and living mingle, stands an apartment building called Maison sans Nom, which is home to a group of boys and girls.

A ruthless boy who knows no pain in his heart. A lonely girl without any friends. A friendly girl who struggles to make connections. A prickly, ambitious girl who is keen to be of help. A boy who loves his own cute self above anything else. A mess of a woman who tries to solve everything through brute force. And a boy with a tender heart who knows no pain in his body.

This ill-assorted group of residents, hands stained with blood from battling the supernatural Maledicts, shall encounter the hearts they never knew and begin nurturing their souls.

The human heart is hut a vessel for pain.

To protect this pain akin to love… To gently break the world apart, piece by piece… Even if it means abandoning humanity. That’s why the heart is but a vessel for pain.

For life blazes brilliantly, while the heart goes around in an endless cycle.",

You wake up in Galgenbeck, a revolting cluster of shanties and ruins-to-be scattered around the greatest cathedral of the dying lands, dedicated to the doomsday following of the two-headed Basilisks. From the Cathedral’s blackened spires slithers a voice and a truth: the world is ending. The two-headed Basilisks demand an offering. This will delay the inevitable end of all things.

There is another voice. From the shit-reeking alleys where the rabble and gutterscums fester, a rumor: whoever appeases this demand will receive Arch-Priestess Josilfa Migol’s blessing. She will cleanse heretic souls and grant them passage to the Shimmering Fields when the true time comes.

The ones desperate enough to embark on this quest are dubbed cursed walkers, and you are one of them. You know that your foul soul is rotting, and every night, you are tormented by visions of eternal damnation. You need a way out. One way or another.

Gather Your Party
Cursed walkers in MÖRK BORG Heresy Supreme are no fantasy heroes. This miserable world is dying, and everyone is looking for salvation, wealth, or vengeance; you can try to cross your destiny with other walkers and form a party, but they will all join you for a reason. Keep everyone’s agenda in mind during the exploration, and you might just get along. Wrong a companion, and they’ll turn their back on you. Or put a dagger in yours. “Friendly” is such an alien world in the brutal, dying world of MÖRK BORG. Remember that when someone offers their help!
Explore the Dying World
The world outside Galgenbeck’s walls is divided into regions, each one worse than the other. Locations and adventures are dynamically generated based on your progress and the quests you’ll stumble into. Quests, adventures, bosses, and special items reset on every playthrough. Explore the dying world but don't get lost in it. You won't get out alive.

Getting Better (or worse)
MÖRK BORG Heresy Supreme doesn’t have XP or the like. Instead, you level up by performing certain actions during your adventures. When you level up, some of your characters’ abilities will get better, but some will get WORSE. The more you level up, the higher the chances you may lose something in the process. Can’t teach an old goblin new tricks! They’ll kill you.

Miseries
The world is breaking apart before the end, as it was written in the Calendar of Nechrubel. Miseries are cataclysmic events that will affect the entire world and the poor creatures dwelling in it. The more you play and the deeper you crawl into the filth, the more Miseries you get. They can trigger when you end an adventure and the closer you get to the Apocalypse the more likely this is.Rumors say that these Miseries can be delayed. The foolish claim that they can be prevented but nobody these are all unconfirmed heresies. And whatever the price is for such an unholy miracle, it's unpayable.
Omens
This world is unforgiving, but Cursed Walkers have a secret trick: Omens that can be spent to deal max damage, reroll an ability check in a crucial situation, absorb the damage from a fatal blow, or guarantee a safe outcome from wielding the Power of a scroll. So remember, you can rely on the fickle fates of alternate worlds tangled with the eyes of eldritch watchers if you want… just don’t tell the Inquisition.

Arcane Catastrophes
Some classes can wield Powers from esoteric and ancient scrolls. In the dying world of MÖRK BORG, conjuring such witchcraft is never guaranteed. Every scroll has a chance to trigger an arcane catastrophe, and nobody can foresee what kind of disaster it could bring. You may get dizzy and start puking… or explode. However, some arcane catastrophes might even be better than the intended effect. Use at your own risk.
RPG Elements
Every character has four abilities — Strength, Agility, Presence, and Toughness — that determine your likelihood of survival. They affect mechanics and interactions with the world, enemies, and other characters. Some encounters, events, and choices require you to roll a d20 modified by the relevant ability. You should always put your life in the hands of a die roll. That’s why it’s called die roll.

The End is (always) Nigh
Once you have the relics demanded by the two-headed Basilisk, get your ugly sack of bones and blood to the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead and face the terrifying presence of Verhu, the truth speaker and the most worshiped of the Basilisk heads, and Gorgh, and his envious brother. Will you be able to appease them in time and cleanse your rotting soul by delaying the apocalypse? Will this torment ever end? Or will your repeated sufferings open your soul to the Heresy Supreme?",

Beware of the sinister plushie robots that haunt the park, trying to keep you from discovering the truth. Survive by hiding, setting traps, or confronting them. As you progress through the story, these robots will become increasingly aggressive. Fortunately, along your journey, you will also encounter friendly robots who will help you achieve your objectives and fight the evil ones!

Your slingshot is your best friend! Use it to shoot active elements like electric boxes, gumball dispensers, or fire extinguishers to attack your enemies and slow them down. The slingshot isn't just for fighting; it can also be used to interact with your surroundings, solve puzzles, and unlock secrets. Most importantly, remember to regularly fill your backpack with gumballs from the dispensers located throughout the park.

In certain areas of the park, you'll encounter patrolling robots such as Gummy and Scrawny. Fighting them isn't always an option; at times, survival hinges on finding a hiding spot. Seek sanctuary inside lockers, beneath beds, or within the rides situated in the lobby. Additionally, the karts in the lobby provide a means of evading your adversaries.",

Heroes will often come for supplies, enriching the treasury to some extent. Taxes are the foundation of any commonwealth. Without them, the kingdom will starve - tax collectors will ensure this doesn’t happen by routinely visiting every building in the city.
Another source of income for the kingdom is from caravans. Protect your own and plunder others to become even richer and more influential. After all, it is your land, and you have the right to combat smuggling within its borders.

What could be better than the smell of a fire storm in the mornings? Only the scent of singed goblins who have decided to attack you! Use the arsenal of spells available to court wizards to destroy your enemies, aid allied heroes, and summon magical creatures into battle.
You can learn new spells in the library or from the guilds of heroes. If you want to use them a distance away from the castle, build beacons.",

AN ANCIENT WORLD TO EXPLORE

Mictlan is set in a fantasy world heavily inspired by pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, customs, and myths. You will find yourself immersed in a wide, varied and dark open world, exploring detailed locations with great visual and narrative depth, experiencing a culturally rich atmosphere that belongs to an irretrievable past.

FIGHT AND SURVIVE

Master the fight and emerge a true warrior, engaging both in melee/ranged combat and spellcasting, an exciting and fluid system, suiting players’ different attack styles. In crafting Mictlan's weapons, we aimed at balancing fun with historical accuracy, recreating ancient weapons and armour.

- Slash and cut your enemies with the deadly Macuahuitl, a wooden club with shiny, sharp and cruel obsidian pieces embedded in its sides.
- Keep enemies at distance using the Tepoztopilli, a long pole-arm weapon the height of a man, with its superior reach and thrusting ability.
- Throw your spears from a great distance with deadly force and speed using the lethal Atlatl, easily piercing through any armor or enemy.
- Increase your magic skills and conjure spells to summon spirits, defeat enemies and protect yourself.

AN AUTHENTIC STORY

Mictlan is an indie game by a small studio with big aspirations. We take pride in two unique aspects of our game: it is the first semi-open world video game ever created by a Mexican-American studio, and it is the first video game completely based on Mesoamerican history and culture. With our game, we want to provide players with a challenging and engaging story, but also with the opportunity for celebrating indigenous cultures by reviving thousand-years-old tales.

HISTORY MEETS FANTASY

At the core of our project is a varied and rich world where history meets fantasy. One of our main goals was to recreate with great accuracy the architecture and iconography of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, drawing evidence from textual descriptions and material remains, all wrapped up in a fantasy setting. Mictlan’s stunning environments, architectural elements, objects and characters are designed using real-life references, locations and archeological sites, providing players with a truly immersive experience, while also enjoying classic fantasy elements. The game blends history and fantasy together as an epic retelling of the most pivotal and bloody moments in ancient Mesoamerican history.

VALUING MESOAMERICAN CULTURES

At the heart of Mictlan, lies a great story and the revival of long-lost civilizations. Our ambition is to make a game which is not only engaging and fun, but which also allows the gamers to get to know Mexican and Mesoamerican history. 2021 marks the 500th anniversary of Mexico’s independence. Valuing such a rich heritage, ancient culture, practices and myths, is one of our project's driving principles. That's why our game will be fully dubbed in ""Nahuatl"", the language spoken by the indigenous inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico, and in “Yucatec Mayan”, the Mayan language spoken in the Yucatán Peninsula and northern Belize.",

In the not-so-distant future, cats rule the world. An intelligent breed of hunter-scientists, they created giant robots called Guardians in the image of their ancestral owners. With the power of Guardian technology, they became the apex species of the new world - Nekovia.

However, hubris is a power that corrupts all.

Through their greed and constant desire for power, Nyankind continued to push technology to the bleeding edge. They conducted their first nekogenic graft in an effort to fuse their feline DNA with guardians, in an attempt to enhance their abilities and reflexes. It worked, but there were some unforeseen side effects. A dormant feral sentience began to awaken within each guardian, perhaps sensing the unnatural union of machine and fur. Feralization was irreversible, and countless Nyans became prey to their own creations. The casualties were immense, and the remainder of the survivors fled underground.

They began to rebuild. A routine exploratory mission led to the discovery of Nyanite, a rare material found near the Earth's core, one that would eventually stabilize the process of nekogenic grafting and prevent feralization. Using the power of Nyanite, the survivors rebuilt their city underground - now known as New Nekovia, the city with holographic skies.

It is a vibrant city full of optimism and hope - filled with heroes that dream of a better future. At the center lies the Battledome, a futuristic training facility that also serves as a reminder of the past and a symbol of hope for the future. Nowadays, Guardian Battles are the most popular sport in New Nekovia, with extravagant competitions and lavish prizes for winning teams. Yet as countless heroes fight for glory and riches, the true meaning behind their fight is never forgotten.",

While working under this new government, a brilliant scientist by the name of Dr. Aura discovered DNA of animals that once populated the planet... animals long extinct, such as dogs and cats. Using this DNA, he created genetically modified animal soldiers, called Bio-Units, to defend the planet from external threats.

However, Dr. Aura's ego began to grow out of his control, and though time, became a tyrant ruling over his own creations. He overthrew the Earth Unit and took over as it's new ruler, using his Bio-Units as his army.

Over time, these Bio-Units began to show their disapproval of Dr. Aura's actions, some even going as far as betraying the Earth Unit and running away, unwilling to participate in his tyrannical actions. Lars, a carefree and over-confident fighter, Kit, a softhearted mechanic, Deon, an arrogant ex-soldier, and Garrison, their strict team captain, teamed up and challenged Dr. Aura to put a stop to his dictatorship.

After a strongly fought battle against his armies, the 4 of them succeeded in overthrowing Dr. Aura, and upon his defeat, took over the Earth Unit. Garrison, the team's captain, became the new head of the planet, and began to restore the relations between Bio-Units and the people of Earth. Peace became a reality, and a new era in Earth's history was beginning.

However, word of Dr. Aura being sighted recently has caught the attention of Garrison, Lars, Kit, and Deon. It was under everyone's understanding that Dr. Aura was dead, defeated in battle years ago.

One meter down... you lose 1% of your chance to survive. I live on the edge of life and death.

Because down here... one mistake, and you're never coming back up.

It's not just a job. It's a life... a battle... a fight for survival.

It has the dual capacity to supply power and transmit information. However, contact with its overwhelming power destroys the integrity of the human body. Despite this danger, Q-Bits have the potential to improve technology performance and render other energy sources obsolete.

To interact with Q-Bits, Cybermask developed the Multi-Interface Neural Device (M.I.N.D.), allowing humans to transfer their consciousness directly to the OverNet. There, they manifest as OverKnights, avatars made of data. However, only 1% of the population is compatible with the M.I.N.D., prompting the ZOI to identify and provide compatible individuals with the necessary resources for exploration.

At the heart of the Institute lies the only portal to the Overnet yet discovered. OverKnights equipped with a M.I.N.D. can access this portal, leading to a replica of the institute within the Overnet a digital hub for all OverKnights operations.

All individuals equipped with a M.I.N.D. have autonomy over its use. However, they are encouraged to participate in controlled battles to study Q-Bits and improve their usability. OverKnights are ranked based on their performance in battles and rewarded accordingly.

In these battles, the M.I.N.D. manifests as a collection of 40 cards representing various actions, reactions, and artifacts. Players have the agency to customize their cards by combining different effects, costs, and conditions. Additionally, OverKnights can equip armored suits with various abilities to match their gameplay style.

When OverKnights are defeated in battle, their consciousness is safely returned to their real-life body before integration with the Overnet, preventing them from becoming ethereal entities.",

Experience a story-driven campaign! Fight for your Sanity and defeat the Lovecraftian horrors.

Last Spartan sees you playing as the titular Last Spartan as you battle through a story-driven randomly generated campaign where keeping a grip on your waning sanity becomes increasingly difficult as you do battle with more and more enemies that draw inspiration from Greek mythology and the Lovecraft mythos.

It's a roguelike with deck-building elements. The unique part here is that your deck is actually a set of customisable dices, with each face acting as a slot for a different ability. There are over 700+ dice faces to discover, allowing you to develop and learn numerous synergies to suit your preferred playstyle, especially when god selection comes into play.

Aside from the dice, you will be accompanied on each run by an ally Greek god. There are over 10 of them currently, although they won't all be unlocked immediately, and each provides distinct active and passive abilities. With them, you can develop different strategies for dealing with the many foes you encounter.

According to the developer, for the first ten hours, you will face new enemies on every run, with over 100 regular enemies and 20-plus mini-bosses to discover and fight in turn-based combat. This should keep the game feeling fresh and surprising for far longer than other entries in the genre.

The same applies to encounters with over 200 NPCs to meet and choices surrounding them to make. Depending on your interaction, they might provide you with a reward, blessings, or even curses that will remain constant until the end of that particular run.

Some of those NPCs will make their way to your city. It's here where you respawn after dying and spend resources you've gathered throughout each run to upgrade the various buildings in a bid to rebuild Sparta. This is the more permanent side of the Last Spartan game and will eventually provide you with perks that increase your chance of completing a run and progressing the overarching story.

The indie game Last Spartan is set to come out in early access on PC/Mac/Linux via Steam in February-March 2024 and full release coming to all Platforms and major storefronts by April 2024 ( Coming to PC/Mac/Linux first and then to all major consoles like Xbox & Playstation & Nintendo Switch & IOS soon after PC and console release )",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7boc.jpg,,"Single player, Multiplayer",,"Third person, Bird view / Isometric, Side view","Action, Fantasy, Horror, Historical, Mystery","King Leonidas and his Spartan warriors return victorious from their campaigns.

INAYAH – Live After Gods takes place in massive, self-sufficient towers called arcologies, constructed on a post-apocalyptic Earth by an alien race known as the Forerunners. The Forerunners, defeated in an interstellar war, sought refuge on Earth to rebuild their forces and exact revenge using humanity, their ancient creation. However, they arrived to find a ravaged world. Undeterred, the Forerunners built the arcologies, resurrected humanity through cloning, and created a haven within the towers.​

Driven by their need for an army, the Forerunners accelerated human evolution through mutations and cybernetic enhancements, transforming them into ""super soldiers."" This plan, however, was doomed to fail. The fleeing Forerunners carried a virus from their enemies, a plague that ravaged their bodies and turned them into monstrous ""statues."" In a desperate bid for survival, one Forerunner created hybrid offspring from human and Forerunner DNA. INAYAH herself is one such hybrid. These hybrids, along with pure humans, remained immune to the devastating virus.​

Five centuries later, humanity has fragmented into tribes within the arcology, clinging to survival and viewing the Forerunners' advanced technology as magic. Their attempts to harness this power has led to the arcology's deterioration. Some tribes revere the Forerunners as gods, worshiping their ""statues,"" while others fear their return and prepare for conflict.

These young people, drowning under the weight of crushing loans, receive an unexpected invitation: compete in a high-stakes game with a single promise—wipe away all their debt, if they can survive.

But once the participants accept, they are whisked away to an opulent yet eerie abandoned cinema. The massive auditorium, once filled with joyous moviegoers, now serves as the twisted arena for the games. The participants find themselves at the mercy of the Watashi Group, whose masked, enigmatic spectators watch from the shadows, delighting in the unfolding chaos like a grotesque form of entertainment. Behind their elaborately designed masks, these wealthy onlookers bet on the players' fates, relishing in the thrill of deception, betrayal, and survival.

The rules are deceptively simple: complete a series of challenges where only the cunning, ruthless, and manipulative can thrive. Every game is a test of wits, strategy, and trust, where alliances are temporary and betrayal is the norm. As the clock ticks down, participants must navigate the ever-changing landscape of the cinema arena, where even a single mistake can mean elimination—and more than just financial ruin.

To the outside world, the participants have vanished, believed to have run away to escape their burdens. But inside the cinema, they face a far darker reality. Those who win are granted the ultimate prize: freedom from their financial chains. But for the losers, the cost is more than just debt—it’s their very lives.

Use unorthodox Terror Tactics such as field interrogations, the Stuka’s iconic Jericho Trumpet, or V1 Rocket Strikes to force the enemy from the field, or show the enemy no quarter with Weapon Superiority and the King Tiger heavy tank.

Seize territory to gain unparalleled momentum on the battlefield, and deploy powerful incendiary weapons to displace any who dare deny your movement.

Call upon Canadian Shock Sections and aggressive battlefield tactics to secure ground in a Shock Assault, or deny the enemy what they stubbornly refuse to cede with Incendiary Weapons, including the indefatigable Churchill Crocodile.

Afrikakorps – Panzerjäger Kommand Battlegroup
Cripple the enemy’s advance with defensive obstacles, enabling powerful anti-armor weapons to make the killing blow.

Faint voices echo through the halls, objects seem to shift when you're not looking, and buried memories start to resurface—memories you’re not sure you want to remember.The house is leading him somewhere, pushing him toward something he doesn’t want to see.",

There’s a farm that’s closed and fields with ripening winter vegetables. In the distance you can see snow capped mountains and the beautiful, clear waters of the sea.

…and out in the distance stood a tower of unimaginable height who’s purpose was anyone’s guess which stretched into the depths of the sky.

This wasn’t a fantasy, or something out of sci-fi or even a mystery. With all that going on, the only intent was to spend some peaceful days with these four girls but that was totally not what was about to happen.

With summer break over, a new semester of fall events awaits. There’s the annual academy festival, the sports meet—the list goes on! As I walk to class on my first day, my heart races in anticipation at what my new campus life will be like. That is, until students start approaching me a short distance from the campus gate… You see, Ainoshima Academy has two student councils that are always vying against each other. Here, let me break it down for you real quick:

Gekka Council: Steeped in history and tradition, Gekka is as old as the academy itself. Its supporters wear uniforms featuring flowing, dark-green skirts for added noblesse.

Gekka President Alicetia: “Join Gekka… Let’s be friends…”

Tendo Council: Tendo is a new student council that was formed after Gekka. Its supporters prefer a dress style that incorporates the latest in uniform chic, including burgundy bolero jackets, pleated miniskirts, and neckties.

Tendo President Usagi: “Join Tendo—let’s get this academy inspired!”

Meanwhile, various student associations have been involved in a proxy war, with the sports teams supporting Gekka and the liberal arts clubs backing Tendo. Before I transferred, the student vote was split evenly between them, which means my vote will be the one that decides who gets the majority! Word has it that a similar deadlock happened six years ago, and it was a transfer student who broke it. Coincidence, huh? Anyway, as you can imagine, since day one of me moving here, neither faction will give me a moment’s peace! This isn’t how my sister said it would be at all…?!

Gekka Vice President Mashiro: “I wish the sports jocks and liberal arts gang could just get along.”

Tendo Secretary Tateha: “With your vote, something might actually change around here.”

I was planning to live my new campus life in peace, but as the academy’s 777th student, the entire student population is watching my every move. Being 777 might sound like the jackpot, but the way things are going, I just might be the unluckiest guy here…

You are wise to come here. So many warriors before you attempted to unite this realm under their reign. They were brave and strong. They had the noble knowledge of tactics. They knew how to choose the best steel for swords. They had fists that could punch holes through stone walls. They had eyes that could spot a sneaking ninja in the middle of a cloudy night. They had hearts that knew no fear nor remorse. But none of them came to seek advice of an old man living on the mountain. And--one by one--they failed. Their power crumbled, their dreams vanished, and their lives faded. You are wise to come here, young nobleman. But this is only your first step towards the true wisdom and the true power that only comes with balance...

Once upon a time there was a proud empire with many great clans. The Serpent Clan ruled this empire while the other clans like the Lotus and Crane maneuvered for greater control of it. It is said, that in those times a great darkness grew from the shadows and formed sinister creatures of pure night. Like droplets of rain they dotted the land and overwhelmed the one clan after another. Tarrant, the leader of the Serpent clan, was the first to accept the fate of the empire. He fled to the south with the remnants of the Serpent Clan and its prized possession, the Dragon Orb.

Further and further they travelled until he could see the Southern Seas and the end of the land. It was here that he turned and faced the Horde. Summoning all the power of the Dragon Orb, he separated the southern tip of the continent from the rest of the mainland with the awesome power of the orb. Neither it nor he would ever be seen again. The Horde could not cross running water, so Tarrant had saved his people at the cost of his own life and the Orb.

To this protected place came two other Clans, the Lotus and the Wolf. The Lotus Clan, twisted and corrupt managed to cross to safety by means unknown.

In the chaotic aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, when hope seemed all but lost, a new threat emerged from the shadows—Moon , a ruthless and enigmatic figure who would come to dominate the forest landscape. His origins shrouded in mystery, Moon’s true identity remained a closely guarded secret, hidden behind a mask that concealed his every feature.

Amassing a formidable band of loyal followers, Moon quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with. His modus operandi was simple yet effective: he would target the weaker camps, extorting their precious resources through a combination of intimidation and brute force. Moon’s insatiable thirst for power and control knew no bounds, and he would stop at nothing to maintain his dominance over the forest.

Hanks, the resolute leader of Camp One, was among the first to recognize the imminent danger posed by Moon . A seasoned military veteran, Hanks had honed his survival skills in the wilderness, and he understood the importance of unity and resilience in the face of such a formidable adversary. Yet, even as he harbored a deep-seated enmity towards Moon , Hanks remained uncertain about the true extent of his rival’s resources and capabilities

Moon’s true strength lay not only in his physical prowess and the loyalty of his followers but also in the veil of secrecy that shrouded his every move. He was a master of deception, always keeping his face hidden behind the mask, and his subordinates were fiercely devoted to maintaining his anonymity. This aura of mystery only served to amplify Moon’s reputation, striking fear into the hearts of those who dared to challenge his authority.

As Hanks and his camp struggled to maintain their fragile existence, the threat of Moon loomed ever larger. The conflict between the two leaders had become a battle of wits, with Hanks constantly seeking ways to outmaneuver his elusive foe. Yet, with Moon’s resources and influence growing by the day, the stakes had never been higher, and the fate of the forest – and perhaps even the remnants of humanity – hung in the balance.",95.14242878560721

It is an especially cold January, and amid the dour gray snow, a funeral is being held. A portrait of a girl's face sits there draped in snow, looking almost embarrassed and a little lonely...

The imprisoned painter Shinzo Mamiya died a scant few weeks after the Blessed Congregation's crimes came to light. Detective Reiji Tokisaka has been recruited by his old friend Maris Stella to help sort through the man's belongings, but instead they find an unknown work in his studio: a one-winged angel with no arms. The work, which they name Exile Of Paradise, is as beautiful as it is sinister—and it resembles his infamous masterpiece Girl In Shell.

A few more days later, a woman's corpse is found, modified in the manner depicted in Exile. She is identified as having formerly worked with Tomoyuki Masaki.

There may be no one left who can cut the chain of obsession that began with Girl In Shell—nobody but one small girl.

In this cozy exploration game with a rogue-lite twist, you have a clear mission: Rescue the Knacks that lost their way out in the wilds and lead them back to safety. Collect a wide assortment of resources to rebuild and expand the village, and transform it into a safe haven for the Knacks!

Traverse various treacherous yet fascinating procedurally generated landscapes and biomes that make each new adventure different from the last. Every biome offers unique challenges and encounters, each needing you to adapt your playstyle if you want to succeed.

Speaking of encounters: The Emberlands isn’t just home to the Knacks, but to many other fantastical creatures! From lazy trolls and crazy scientists, to…chickens?! They all offer their own quests and bargains to you. While some may seem rather dubious, they all promise unique rewards, from resources and tools to upgrades to your equipment. Choose which offers you are willing to take — it’s all up to you!

As you bring back precious resources and answer the calls of the Knacks, aiding them in rebuilding stores and homes, your village will expand and thrive, paving the way for future exploration. Each addition to your village brings you one step closer to unlocking the mysteries of the Miasma.

Praesidium, a cabal of the most powerful private corporations, has seized control of over 90% of the world's natural resources.

Why?

Because they could.

Greed won the war before it began.
Praesidium forged false alliances with select nations and signed contracts giving them full access to each of the nation's resources. They also ran successful propaganda campaigns, encouraging these same nations to compete with one another politically and ultimately militarily. This strategy slowly but surely weakened all nations who struggled to maintain control over their people and their land as their wealth, which was tied to the very resource rights they had signed away, was stripped.

When the nations of the world were sufficiently weakened, Praesidium moved on the world's most resource rich lands with a vast private army, which was funded by the unlimited wealth of the world's corporate powers.

This private army became known as Praesidium's Shield. They did not conquer nations, they simply moved into resource rich regions, constructed defensive strongholds and seized control of the world's various natural resources.

Nations crumbled as they fought against Praesidium and each other, in order to secure remnants to sustain their economies and their way of life.

Eventually, there were no nations powerful enough to challenge Praesidium's dominance...

...until now.

Endeavor is a newly formed resistance force. Made up of the most powerful military minds, technology and equipment from each of the world's once mighty nation states who have combined into a single fighting force powerful enough to make a difference.

Hedwig has tried her best, but she is no closer to solving the mystery. Things just keep getting more and more complicated: Why can't any of the Sisters give her a straight answer about what happened the night of the murder? Who--or what--is the mysterious figure that haunts the abbey? And just who was Sister Catherine?

In White Wool & Snow, Sister Hedwig must steel herself. Time is running out, and so is sympathy for her situation. It's understandable that being thrust into the waking world after a life of quiet reflection as an anchoress would require some adjustment, but if Hedwig wants to save an innocent man she will have to get serious fast.

Her presence is no accident. Juna's soul is caught between life and death, trapped in a coma. She must find a way to return home—or choose to remain in Limbo, helping both spirits and humans by influencing events in the Land of the Living.

Her journey hinges on the ancient runes left by shamans or the powers gifted by Limbo's inhabitants. These abilities will be crucial to solving puzzles and uncovering the mysteries that lie ahead.

Limbo is not one vast territory but a mosaic of fragmented lands, each its own micro-dimension. Juna can lose herself exploring its depths, meeting the spirits who call it home, and discovering a realm she once thought unreachable—or simply glimpse it before returning to her life in the Land of the Living.

This mystical shard, entrusted to the High Council of Anor, ensured peace and prosperity for centuries. Yet, as greed and ambition corrupted mortal hearts, a catastrophic war erupted, shattering the shard into countless fragments scattered across the world.

Without the shard's balance, chaos consumed Oryum. The land split into three warring factions, each seeking dominance and the lost fragments of the Eternity Shard to claim ultimate power. Unchecked darkness seeped into the world, giving rise to monstrous creatures and twisted dungeons where the shards remained hidden, guarded by malevolent forces.

Amidst the chaos, the Ancient Guardians, remnants of the old order, whispered of a prophecy: “A hero will rise from the ashes of conflict, one who can reunite the shards, restore balance, and reclaim Oryum’s destiny.”

You are one of the chosen, drawn by fate to embark on this perilous journey. The path will lead you through sprawling cities, treacherous mountains, and haunted ruins, where forgotten secrets and unimaginable dangers lie in wait. Along the way, you'll forge alliances, uncover the truth behind the Eternity Shard's destruction, and confront the darkness threatening to consume all.

Will you restore balance to Oryum and become the legend foretold? Or will the realm succumb to eternal shadow? The choice is yours.

Every hero starts with a dream in his heart, but Leif started with a nightmare that haunted his dreams.

In his dreams, Leif relives his mother’s tragic death. His mother passed away giving birth to him. The guilt and longing for a mother he never knew overshadow his dreams. Each night he fights to save her, only to wake up and to realize that no matter what, he will never be able to change the past.

Leif’s father too is haunted by the past. The death of his wife turned him into an overprotective father. He is scared to lose Leif and will do everything to keep him out of harm’s way.

A father struck with grief and an older brother, Ragnar, the seasoned warrior that everyone looks up to. Leif feels small in the shadow of his family. Will he ever be as brave as his brother? He looks up to him and dreams of becoming a strong warrior like his brother, that protects the village and is trusted by everyone. Ragnar is held in such high esteem that he was chosen to undertake the monthly dragon ritual.

Leif’s village honors the belief that two dragons fight an eternal battle in the sky. The dragon serving the light and the dragon creating the darkness. This battle has been going on since the beginning of time.

The villagers believe that they must bring the dragon of light offerings each month so that he remains strong and defeats the dragon of darkness. The ritual is key in keeping the balance between light and darkness.

Leif’s brother was chosen to bring the offerings to the Dragon’s horn at the top of the mountain so that the dragon of light can feast and replenish, thus gaining strength for a new cycle of battles.

Leif dreams of becoming an admired warrior like his brother. But Leif's father thinks differently. Leif’s future is set in stone. He is destined to be the blacksmith's assistance.

Fire and steal instead of the cold blade in battle. Forging the blades for the warriors instead of becoming one himself.

At night Leif sneaks into the village tavern to listen to songs of heroes’ past and dreams about becoming one himself. He dreams that one day they will sing a song about his epic battles.

But someone is never seen of late at the tavern. Leif’s brother Ragnar is keeping watch at night. Something is keeping him up and he gazes upon the darkness weary of an evil force. Leif tries to understand what is going on with his brother. His brother is keeping a secret from him. But what could it be? He will find out soon enough.

On the morning of the ritual things are unraveling fast. Leif's village is attacked by Phantom Warriors. No mortal blade can harm these evil forces from another dimension. Only the dragon sword Ragnar carries can defeat them. Leif's father wants to protect Leif. He doesn't think Leif to be strong enough to fight in the battle. Instead, he is sent away to find his brother.

Leif runs as fast as his legs can carry him to the top of the mountain where he believes the ritual to be taking place. But things have taken a different turn of events. For there is no dragon, but a great evil awaiting Leif.

Leif arrives too late. In horror, he watches as his brother is fatally wounded by an evil foe and thrown into a magical portal. Little does Leif know that the evil force he witnessed has been the cause of the danger brought upon his village. Minjaar is the master of the Phantom Warriors and the darkness lurking in the shadow of his dreams.

Now it is upon Leif to save his brother and his village. Leif has no choice but to jump after his brother through the portal. And so his quest to the Netherworld begins. The quest to save his brother, village, and most importantly learn the true meaning of being a hero.",
